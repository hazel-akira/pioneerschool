We require our students to read extensively from the broad range of increasingly challenging literary and technical material across all subjects in form 1 and 2 which helps them better determine their specializations in senior high (form 3 and 4). We not only design the curriculum to cultivate well-rounded, intelligent, and socially aware boys, but it is also tailored to deliver excellent academic results. Regardless of background or prior ability, we aim to secure the best outcomes for all our boys, ensuring that our curriculum gives a solid foundation for future careers."
